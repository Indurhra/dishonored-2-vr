//! The skeletons of the characters around the player, as the engine has them posed THIS frame (2026-10-05, the development notes
//! part 36): what the sword's contact test strikes instead of a box.
//!
//! A character's render-model box is its bind pose (standing, arms out): a guard bending to block, a sleeper, a corpse
//! on the floor all kept a 1.8 m standing column at the entity's origin, and the blade met them only where that column
//! crossed the body (the user: "only a thrust to the middle of the chest hits the corpse"). The engine keeps every joint
//! of a skinned model in a pose array (`obj+0x2D8`, 64-byte entries: three axis rows, then the position at +0x30, in
//! model space -- exe+0x9B900), where `obj` is the skeleton object whose +0x38 is the arkSkinnedRenderModel (the same
//! pointer as the entity's model, entity+0xF0); the model's world transform is model+0x1860/+0x186C. A ragdoll writes
//! there too, so a corpse's joints lie where its body is drawn.
