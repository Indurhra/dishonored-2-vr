//! Effects anchored to the first-person arms come out of the hand the player SEES.
//!
//! The mod poses the arms on the GPU only (GpuTrace rewrites each arm draw's joint palette, M' = D * M), so the
//! engine's own skeleton keeps the animated pose. Everything the engine anchors to an arm joint -- Far Reach's tendril
//! and its hand cloud, Blink's hand smoke, the aiming glow of every power -- is placed from that skeleton, and came
//! out of an invisible hand the animation left behind (measured: Far Reach's tendril started ~40 cm left of the drawn
//! hand and did not follow it at all).
//!
//! Every such query goes through two small engine functions that return a joint of a model in MODEL space from the
//! animated pose array (exe+0x53D3F0 with a local offset, exe+0x53D6A0 without); the world-space wrappers
//! (exe+0x53D800, exe+0x53D940, and the by-name exe+0x53DAC0 with its 86 callers) are built on them. They are hooked
//! here, and when the model is one of the player's arms the result gets the same per-segment delta the palette
//! rewrite gives that bone -- so the effect and the drawn hand share one pose and cannot drift apart. Nothing is
//! written to the engine's skeleton, and nothing else (the aim, the power's target) is touched.
