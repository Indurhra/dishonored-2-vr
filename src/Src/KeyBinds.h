//! The keys the game listens to, as the game names them. Dishonored 2 reads the keyboard through DirectInput, i.e.
//! by the key's PHYSICAL position (DIK codes = set-1 scan codes): its "W" is the key left of E on any layout. So a key
//! is sent by that scan code, never through the Windows layout -- on a French AZERTY layout the layout's 'W' is the key
//! the game calls "Z" (zoom). And the player may have rebound an action: the bindings are read from the game's own
//! config (Saved Games\Arkane Studios\Dishonored2\base\dishonored2Config.cfg, the IN_GAME set) so the controllers press
//! whatever key the game expects for that action.
